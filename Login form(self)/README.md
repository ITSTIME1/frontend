# Login_form_self
It is a project that changed the exisiting Login form project in my own way

# why did you run this project?
That's very simple answer! because login page projects is to changed your HTML website or Dynamic website
Every time you build  a website, you have to capture important information from the client 
At that time, we proceeded with the login form page project because the first part shown was to decide whether to continue or quit using your website.
